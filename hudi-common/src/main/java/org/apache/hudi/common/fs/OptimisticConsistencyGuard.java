/**
 * A consistency guard which sleeps for configured period of time only on APPEAR. It is a no-op for DISAPPEAR.
 * This is specifically for S3A filesystem and here is the rational.
 * This guard is used when deleting data files corresponding to marker files that needs to be deleted.
 * There are two tricky cases that needs to be considered. Case 1 : A data file creation is eventually consistent and hence
 * when issuing deletes, it may not be found. Case 2: a data file was never created in the first place since the process crashed.
 * In S3A, GET and LIST are eventually consistent, and delete() implementation internally does a LIST/EXISTS.
 * Prior to this patch, hudi was leveraging {@link FailSafeConsistencyGuard} which was doing the following to delete data files.
 * Step1: wait for all files to appear with linear backoff.
 * Step2: issue deletes
 * Step3: wait for all files to disappear with linear backoff.
 * Step1 and Step2 is handled by {@link FailSafeConsistencyGuard}.
 *
 * We are simplifying these steps with {@link OptimisticConsistencyGuard}.
 * Step1: Check if all files adhere to visibility event. If yes, proceed to Sptep 3.
 * Step2: If not, Sleep for a configured threshold and then proceed to next step.
 * Step3: issue deletes.
 *
 * With this, if any files that was created, should be available within configured threshold(eventual consistency).
 * Delete() will return false if FileNotFound. So, both cases are taken care of this {@link ConsistencyGuard}.
